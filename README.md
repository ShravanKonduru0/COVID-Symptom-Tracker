# COVID-Symptom-Tracker
While our capability to deliver large scale testing for the Covid-19 virus grows
consistently, there is still not nearly enough. With this in mind, our team set out 
to create an application through which potential testers could evaluate whether or not
they were at risk of infection. We take a large variety of metrics and ask the user
rate the severity of their symptoms, having them enter information daily, as there is a
difference in having a symptom for one day compared to multiple days. We compare the 
information entered by the user to the official data on the Covid-19 virus to form a
recommendation. We recognize that the recommendation formed by the app is no replacement 
for testing, but we feel that it could be used as a powerful tool to minimize the number
of people testing due to hysteria and encourage those actually in risk to seek out tests. 
As a result of having a more informed public,the overall efficiency of the testing process would benefit.
